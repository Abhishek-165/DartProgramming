void main()
{
  
 // we can define varible by two ways in dart programming
 // Let's see both one by one

  // 1st way, Here we need to define the variable to the coressponding data type like
 int a=0;
 
  print(a);
  
  String s ="Dart Programming";
  
  print("$s");   // variable value will be printed in the literal like this
  
 
  bool b = false;
  
  print(b);
  
  // 2nd Way, Here compiler automatically understands the type of the variable like javascript
  
  var ab=1;
  var abs='string';
  
  print (ab);
  print(abs);
  
}
